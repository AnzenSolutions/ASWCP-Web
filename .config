# Config for ASWCP Web Panel.

# Comments should start with a "#" or ";".

# The config file parser reads items in a key=value style manner, but 
# accomendates the fact that spaces of any amount can be used separating key and value entries.

# Strings/text don't have to be enclosed in quotes unless the string is a number or boolean (True or False).
# The parser does its best at auto-determining if a value is numeric, string, boolean, etc...
# To see how the parser works look at konf.py

# The port number for the web panel to connect to.  1337 chosen for default out of laziness

# "It should be a long, random sequence of bytes to be used as the HMAC secret for the signature."
