Installation
-------------
To install the web panel an install script has been done to make the process 
easier for the end user.  Simply run the following command:
```wget -O - -o /dev/null https://raw.github.com/AnzenSolutions/ASWCP/master/web/install.sh | sh -```
This will download and pass the script to your shell.  After that, just make the appropriate 
edits to ".config" in the directory and run the server.py script.
